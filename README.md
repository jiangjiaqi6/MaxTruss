# MaxTruss : I/O Efficient Max-Truss Computation in Large Static and Dynamic Graphs
## Datasets
We collect 168 real-world networks of various types, along with 3 synthetic graphs, all of which are undirected. Among these datasets, the synthetic graphs Kron29
is generated by Graph500 kronecker (https://graph500.org/). The remaining networks are sourced from the Koblenz Network Collection (http://konect.unikoblenz.de/), the Stanford Network Collection (http://snap.stanford.edu/data/), the Web Graph Collection (http://webgraph.di.unimi.it/)

### Input graph
```
graph:
    1
  /  \
 2 —— 3
edge list format:
1 2
1 3
2 3
```

## Command
```
"Usage: ./executable_file -f [data_file_path] -m [method] -d [dir]"
./main -f /mnt/hdd0/jjq/graphData/arabic/arabic-2005.edges -m 1 -d arabic
```

## Notice for Compilation Options

### -DLazyUpdate

```
In the SemiLazyUpdate algorithm, the newly designed data structure LHDH is used. if we do not use “-DLazyUpdate”, then algorithm SemiGreedyCore is executed.
```

### -DMaintenance

```
If we need to maintain $k_{max}$-truss after computing it, then we need to use the compilation option -DMaintenance.
```
